\item{data}{The name of a tab-separated file that contains the data.}

\item{file}{\code{character(1)}. The name of a file xxx}

\item{sample}{A dataframe describing the samples (in lines).}

\item{indQData}{A vector of string where each element is the name
of a column in designTable that have to be integrated in
the \code{rowData()} table of the \code{QFeatures} object.}

\item{keyId}{A \code{character(1)} or \code{numeric(1)} which is the indice of the
column containing the ID of entities (peptides or proteins)}

\item{force.na}{A \code{boolean} that indicates if the '0' and 'NaN' values of
quantitative values  must be replaced by 'NA' (Default is FALSE)}

\item{typeDataset}{A string that indicates whether the dataset is about}

is the name of a column in rowData. It contains the id of parent proteins
and is used to generate adjacency matrix and process to aggregation.}

processes which has already been run on the data. Default is 'original'.}

\item{typePipeline}{A \code{character(1)} The type of pipeline used with this
dataset. The list of predefined pipelines in DaparToolshed can be obtained
with the function \code{pipelines()}. Default value is NULL}
