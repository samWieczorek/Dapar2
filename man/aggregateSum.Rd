\title{Compute the intensity of proteins with the sum of the intensities
of their peptides.}
\usage{
aggregateSum(obj.pep, X)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj.pep}{A matrix of intensities of peptides}

\item{X}{An adjacency matrix in which lines and columns correspond
respectively to peptides and proteins.}
}
\value{
A matrix of intensities of proteins
}
\description{
This function computes the intensity of proteins based on the sum of the
intensities of their peptides.
